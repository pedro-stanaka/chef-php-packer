{"name":"zsh","version":"2.0.0","description":"Installs zsh","long_description":"# zsh Cookbook\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/zsh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/zsh) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/zsh.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/zsh)\n\nInstalls zsh package and documentation.\n\n# DEPRECATION NOTICE\nWe believe this cookbook provides little value to the community as the entire actual codebase is less than 10 lines. We have decided to deprecate it, so we can focus our effort on complex cookbooks that provide more value to the overall Chef community. If you have thoughts on how this cookbook could be redesigned to provide more value to the community please reach out to us at cookbooks@chef.io.\n\n## Requirements\n### Platforms\n- Ubuntu/Debian\n- RHEL/CentOS and derivatives\n- Fedora\n- FreeBSD\n\n### Chef\n- Chef 12.0+\n\n### Cookbooks\n- `multipackage`\n- `compat_resources`\n\n## Usage\nWherever you have users who want to use `zsh` as their login shell, use this recipe. For example, add `recipe[zsh]` to a base role applied to all nodes.\n\n## License & Authors\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2008-2015, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"multipackage":"~> 3.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"zsh::default":"Installs zsh."}}
